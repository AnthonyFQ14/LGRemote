Lg Tv Remote to control tv from python

Use lg.py to utilize the pywebostv library which allows you to connect to a lg tv remotely with python and execute commands.

The function of this project was to run the program and have my tv turn on my favorite show with one click.

There is functionality of wake on lan available to be able to turn the tv on remotely as well but it takes quite some time for the magic packet to work if the tv has been off for a while. If the tv is turned off and the magic packet is sent shortly after (1-10 seconds) it works great.
